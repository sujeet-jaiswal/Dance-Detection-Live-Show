# AI Dance Detection Demo

## **Introduction**
The **AI Dance Detection Demo** is a real-time web application that utilizes AI to detect and analyze popular dance styles. This project combines computer vision and machine learning to recognize movements and provide insightful analytics about different dance forms.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Detection:** Identifies and analyzes dance styles instantly.
- **Pose Estimation:** Utilizes AI to draw keypoints and skeletons for visual feedback.
- **Confidence Levels:** Displays probability percentages for each detected dance style.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design with clear analytics for users.

## **Demo**
Access the live demo [here](#) (Add your deployment link).

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **AI Framework:** TensorFlow.js, Teachable Machine Pose
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel (Choose your deployment platform)

## **Getting Started**
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- A modern web browser
- An active internet connection

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Dance-Detection-Demo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Dance-Detection-Demo
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## **How It Works**
1. **Model Loading:** The application loads a pre-trained model from Teachable Machine.
2. **Webcam Integration:** The webcam captures live video feed.
3. **Pose Estimation:** AI processes the video feed to estimate poses and predict dance styles.
4. **Analytics:** Displays detected dance styles and their confidence levels in real-time.

## **Popular Dance Styles Supported**
- Ballet
- Hip Hop
- Salsa
- Contemporary
- Tap Dance
